The [R for Mass Spectrometry](https://RforMassSpectrometry.org) meta-package.

`RforMassSpectrometry` is a meta-package, to manage and document the
RforMassSpectrometry (https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/)
project. The goal of the project to provide efficient, thoroughly
documented, tested and flexible R software for the analysis and
interpretation of high throughput mass spectrometry assays, including
proteomics and metabolomics experiments. The project formalises the
longtime collaborative development efforts of its members under the
RforMassSpectrometry organisation to facilitate dissemination and
accessibility of their work.
