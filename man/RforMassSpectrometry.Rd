\title{The R for MassSpectrometry meta-package}
\description{
RforMassSpectrometry is a meta-package, to manage and document the
RforMassSpectrometry project. The goal of the project to provide
efficient, thoroughly documented, tested and flexible R software
for the analysis and interpretation of high throughput mass
spectrometry assays, including proteomics and metabolomics
experiments. The project formalises the longtime collaborative
development efforts of its members under the RforMassSpectrometry
organisation to facilitate dissemination and accessibility of their
work.
